# RNA-seq practical
This repository collects handout and materials for the RNA-Seq practical


## Practical design
The RNA-seq practical has been designed to let participants explore different tools and strategies for RNA-seq data analysis.
 
The fastq reads are from one of the six samples presented in the study  ([https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1359](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1359). They have been downloaded from [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?linkname=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=387951) and will be analysed in three different ways:

1. the guided transcriptome reconstruction and quantification using the *Tuxedo 2* pipeline;

2. genome alignment and gene quantification using *STAR*;

3. transcript quantification by using *Salmon* for the quasi alignment.   

At the end of the practical participants will compare the table counts of all six samples derived by the three analyses.
